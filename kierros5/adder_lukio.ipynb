    "1. Sum each column from right to left below the line\n",
    "1. If the sum requires two digits (bits) to represent, carry the left bit (at the `10`s place) to the next column and place the right bit (at the `1`s place) under the line\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image, the numbers `21` and `26` are added together in binary. The digit in orange represents the only carry bit that is `1`. The sum is `101111` which is `47` in decimal.\n",

    "The result from `A AND B` is called the _carry_ bit because it is used to carry the overflow from the summation to the next one.

This is why we need to create a binary adder for three bits which is called a full adder.\n",
